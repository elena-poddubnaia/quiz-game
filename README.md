## Development Plan
We want to break the development into three steps: Vue.js, TypeScript, and unit tests. Consider adding the database later in the process.

- [x] Set up the Vue.js project and run it locally.
- [x] Build the simplest version with one question and two answer options. When an answer is selected, the user should be informed whether it is correct or wrong.
- [ ] Make the picked binding work as new.
- [ ] Add dynamic questions

## Reminder 
After adding new code, first think about what you expect to happen. Then, open the browser and check if everything works as you expected (or not).
