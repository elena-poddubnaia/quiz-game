We want to break the development into three steps: Vue.js, TypeScript, and unit tests. Consider adding the database later in the process.

## Quiz-game TODO checklist

- [x] Set up the Vue.js project and run it locally.

- [x] Add dynamic questions
- [x] Consider to add state management with vuex
- [x] Make vuex work: remove binding for options, use mutation instead

## Tips 
After adding new code, first think about what you expect to happen. Then, open the browser and check if everything works as you expected (or not).

Read documentation.
