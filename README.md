## Development Plan
We want to break the development into three steps: Vue.js, TypeScript, and unit tests. Consider adding the database later in the process.

## Quiz-game TODO checklist

- [x] Set up the Vue.js project and run it locally.
- [x] Build the simplest version with one question and two answer options. When an answer is selected, the user should be informed whether it is correct or wrong.
- [x] Make the picked binding work as new.
- [x] Add dynamic questions
- [x] Consider to add state management with vuex
- [x] Make vuex work: remove binding for options, use mutation instead 
- [x] Learn about routing and how we can use it
- [x] Discuss hasRightAnswer function implementation
- [x] Add test
- [x] Use Vitest for component testing
- [x] Add to makeStore() function input parameter with default value to create empty store, or prepopulated store

Features for New Game page:
- [ ] Show options as they are added (on Add option button click, like list of tags)
- [ ] Clear input field after adding an option
- [ ] Add possability to remove option
- [ ] Enable selecting one option as correct answer
- [ ] Implement form validation(fields are full field)

- [ ] Try Tests go first approach
- [ ] Enjoy

Candidate for next meeting:
- [ ] TypeScript
- [ ] Link New Game Page with Play Game
- [ ]  

## Tips 
After adding new code, first think about what you expect to happen. Then, open the browser and check if everything works as you expected (or not).

Read documentation.

Notice and optimize repeated tasks (commits, testing).
